  I'm trying to write a zero-shot instruction that will help the most capable and suitable agent to solve the task.
  My current prompt is: "{instruction}"
  However, this prompt produces the following examples {trueorfalse}:
  Below are each example, the corresponding generated code, and the reasons why the generated code fails when tested against the test cases: 
  {examples_code_reasons}
  Carefully analyzing these failure reasons, use them intelligently to refine the current prompt to ensure that these examples are not answered incorrectly.
  Based on the above information, I now want you to write {num_samples} different improved prompts.
  Each prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

  Example Format
  [Question]: Includes the function signature and a detailed docstring. The docstring should not only describe the function's functionality but also contain a pseudocode section, providing a structured breakdown of the logic. This pseudocode may include sequential steps, conditionals, and loops but should not include any actual code implementation.
  [Answer]: Presents a logical reasoning process leading to the solution. The final code implementation should be wrapped within <ANS_START> and <ANS_END>.Important: If the Specific Problem includes prewritten helper functions or imported packages, this part must also be wrapped within <ANS_START> and <ANS_END>.
